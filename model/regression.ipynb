values above or below this range show a trend that the patients possibility to not have heart disease is decreasing.\n\n*From the plot we can observe that:*\n\nPeople who smoke have higher chances of heart diesease than no smokers.\n\nMale are more prone to suffer from heart diseases as compared to females.\n\nPeople with age limit in between 55-75 has higher chances of getting heart diseases.\n\nIf person has difficulty in walking or climbing stairs there is a high probability that he or she is suffering from some heart disease.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**From Model:-**\n\nBMI, Smoking, Stroke, PhysicalHealth, MentalHealth, DiffWalking, Sex, AgeCategory, Race, Diabetic, Asthma and Kidney
